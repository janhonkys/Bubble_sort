# Bubble sort project

Welcome to the Bubble sort project! This project provides a simple implementation of the Bubble sort algorithm in Java, demonstrating sorting of integer arrays and includes unit tests for validation.

## Project overview

This project implements the Bubble sort algorithm in Java. Key features include:

- **Sorting algorithm**: Implements the Bubble sort algorithm to sort arrays of integers.
- **Random number generation**: Generates an array of random integers between 1 and 2000 for sorting.
- **Console output**: Displays the original and sorted arrays, along with the number of sorting cycles performed.

## Features

- **Bubble sort operation**: Sorts an array of integers using the Bubble sort algorithm.
- **Random array generation**: Generates an array of random integers for sorting demonstration.
- **Console display**: Prints the original array, sorted array, and the number of sorting cycles to the console.

## Testing (JUnit)
- JUnit is used to write and run tests for the application, ensuring the correctness of various functionalities......
